      sentences:
      - "Long-range scanner is now operational. Recalculating the coordinates\u2026"
      - We are currently located in Red Sphere Gate, a nebula notorious for deceiving
        those who enter and leading pilots astray. Several ships have disappeared
        within this area, never to be seen again, and it is therefore widely referred
        to as the Graveyard Gate.

      sentences:
      - "Scanner detects a nearby gravitational force. You might want to take a look
        at that. I\u2019m also picking up a faint signal from deeper within the nebula,
        but I\u2019m unable to identify it."
