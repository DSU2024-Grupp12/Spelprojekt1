  entryContent: "Scanning satellite\u2026\r\n\r\nThis appears to be one of Heliosphere
    Tech\u2019s satellites. It hasn\u2019t been in use for a long time, which makes
    sense, considering Hera\u2019s disappearance. \n\nHera was the clan behind Heliosphere
    Tech, an advanced technology company even in its time. The sun symbol, representing
    their goddess and protector, can be found on all Heliosphere Tech constructions.\n"
